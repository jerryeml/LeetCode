# Topic: 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line
You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

Input: coordinates = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]
Output: true

Input: coordinates = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]]
Output: false

Constraints:

2 <= coordinates.length <= 1000
coordinates[i].length == 2
-10^4 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^4
coordinates contains no duplicate point.


# Topic: Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem

Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in any order the folders after removing.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: / followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, /leetcode and /leetcode/problems are valid paths while an empty string and / are not.

 

Example 1:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
Example 2:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d/" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
Example 3:

Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4
2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'
folder[i] always starts with character '/'
Each folder name is unique.
